//Last Chance for Gas!
//A driver has to determine if they can make it across the desert with their current fuel.
//They are about to past the last gas station for the next 200 miles and they need to determine
//whether they should stop now for gas or not.

//var mpg=prompt("Let's see if your car can make it to the next gas station with out refueling. \nEnter MPG of Vehicle");
//var tankCapacity=prompt("Enter fuel tank capacity.");
//var gasPercent=(prompt("Enter the current fuel level(%)")/100);
//var fuelLeft=(tankCapacity*gasPercent);//Formula
//var milesLeftInTank=(fuelLeft*mpg);


//console.log(fuelLeft);
//console.log(milesLeftInTank);
//(milesLeftInTank>200)? console.log("Yes, you can make it without stopping for gas!"):console.log("You only have "+milesLeftInTank.toFixed(2)+" gallons of gas in your tank, better get gas now while you can!");
